Vision
Imagine a future where 5G networks don’t just connect—they think. NeuraNet brings that vision to life. By blending artificial intelligence with 5G technology, we’re creating self-optimizing networks that learn from real-time data, anticipate user needs, and adapt in milliseconds. From autonomous drones to smart megacities, NeuraNet is the foundation of next-generation connectivity, redefining what’s possible.
Features
NeuraNet unleashes a suite of powerful capabilities to revolutionize 5G management:
Dynamic Network Slicing
Adjusts slice parameters (bandwidth, priority) instantly based on real-time conditions.  
Example: During a massive e-sports event, NeuraNet boosts bandwidth for lag-free streaming to millions.

AI-Powered Optimization
Employs reinforcement learning to predict and enhance slice configurations, improving with every decision.  
Example: In a busy urban center, NeuraNet prioritizes low-latency slices for self-driving cars during peak traffic.

3GPP Standards Compliance
Built with NVIDIA’s Aerial SDK, fully aligned with 3GPP Release 15+ for 5G slicing.  
Example: Telecom providers can integrate NeuraNet into their 5G systems seamlessly.

Scalability
Manages thousands of devices and multiple slices, meeting real-world 5G demands.  
Example: In a dense city hub, NeuraNet handles IoT, broadband, and critical slices effortlessly.

Real-Time Performance
Powered by NVIDIA TensorRT for AI inference in under 1 millisecond.  
Example: For VR gaming, NeuraNet ensures ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) without delays.

AI/ML Workflow
At its heart, NeuraNet runs a reinforcement learning (RL) engine that transforms network slicing:
State Observation  
Input: Real-time network metrics (traffic load, user count, interference, latency).  

Example: [600.0 Mbps, 150 users, 0.2 interference, 4.0 ms latency].

Action Prediction  
Model: A neural network forecasts slice adjustments (bandwidth, priority).  

Example Output: [30.0 MHz, 7, 100.0 MHz, 8] for two slices.

Reward Calculation  
Feedback: Evaluates impact on KPIs (latency, throughput, efficiency).  

Example: A reward of 0.95 if latency drops below 1ms and throughput reaches 12Gbps.

Model Training  
Learning: The RL agent refines its approach using policy gradients.  

Example: After 200 episodes, it optimizes slice allocation for high-traffic scenarios.

Usage:  
Training: Execute train.py to simulate and refine the RL model.  

Inference: Run inference.py for real-time slicing in simulations or live networks.

NVIDIA Tools and Usage
NeuraNet leverages NVIDIA’s cutting-edge tools for AI and 5G:
NVIDIA Aerial SDK  
Purpose: Simulates 5G networks with GPU-accelerated PHY and MAC layers.  

How: Programmable in C++ for precise slice control.  

Example: In network_control.cpp, updateSlices applies AI-driven adjustments.

NVIDIA TensorRT

How: Optimizes the model to meet 5G’s <1ms latency requirements.  

Example: Converted to a TensorRT engine in inference.py.

NVIDIA RAPIDS  
Purpose: Speeds up data preprocessing for training and analytics.  

How: Processes large datasets with GPU efficiency.  

Example: In train.py, RAPIDS manages simulated network data.
